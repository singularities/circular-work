# Circular Work

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularities/circular-work.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularities/circular-work)

Your community tasks, distributed

## Description

Despite communities expect horizontal participation among
their members, the same behaviour is reproduced: only few people
do most of the work, and most participants contribute little.

Circular Work helps organizations to be more participative
through recurrent tasks. Within this tool, organzations
can setup up turns and send reminder emils to the responsibles
each week, automatically rotating turns and ofering
a visible place where looking at them at any time.

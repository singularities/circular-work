# Circular Work

Your community tasks, distributed

## Description

Despite communities expect horizontal participation among
their members, the same behaviour is reproduced: only few people
do most of the work, and most participants contribute little.

Circular Work tries to help to distribute community tasks,
showing clearly the turns in repetitive tasks, 
making easy their management, and sending reminders
when the turn approaches.
